1. run the live server:
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    --> main refer to main.py file
    --> app is instance of class FastAPI
    
2. url where the app is being served
    --> http://127.0.0.1:8000

3. access interactive API docs
    --> Swagger: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
    --> ReDoc: http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc

4. Path operations are evaluated in order. E.g make sure /users/me is declared before /users/{user_id}.
    Otherwise, the path for /users/{user_id} would match also for /users/me, 
    thinking that it's receving a parameter user_id with a value of "me".
